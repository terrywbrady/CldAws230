## Goal
- [DSpace](https://dspace.org) is an open-source repository platform used by academic libraries and other institutions.
- Many institutions have very limited developer support.  End users within these institutions have expertise to offer to the project.
- Ths project will build an automated system to build an deploy a test instance of DSpace using code from a specific [pull request](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pulls).
- The system will carefully manage deployed instnaces in order to control costs.

--- 

## Services Used
- AWS Cloud Formation
- S3
- EC2
- Lambda 
- API Gateway
- Cloud Watch Rules

+++
## Non AWS Services
- GitHub API
- Docker
- Docker Compose (launching DSpace)

## Security and Cost Considerations

- Cost
- Security

+++

## Cost Management

- DSpace requires an m2.large or larger EC2 instance.
- The system will cap the number of instances that can be started at once.
- The system will set an expiration time on each instance.
- A Cloud Watch Rule + Lambda will terminate resources that have exceeded uptime

+++

## Security - Public Web Resources

- EC2 resources will be publicly accessible (for end users)
  - The dashboard will make test resources accessible
- Lambdas will be publicly accessible
  - The StartInstance lambda could trigger a costly resources
  - Perhaps some additional verification could be added here

+++

## Security - CORS
- CORS resources are wide open
+++

## Security - EC2 Ports
- The ports on the running DSpace instances could be more carefully restricted

+++

## Security - Keyfile

- A specifically named keyfile is specified on startup.  
- While the file is not exposed, a more elegant approach is needed

---

## Demonstration

- Dashboard (Web App): Start, List, Stop
- DSpace: View default
- Create a DSpace PR
- Deploy PR
- DSpace: View modified version

+++
- TBD: Dashboard (Web App): Start, List, Stop

+++
- TBD: - DSpace: View default

+++
- TBD: - Create a DSpace PR

+++
- TBD: - Deploy PR

+++
- TBD: - DSpace: View modified version

## Further Enhancements

- Functionality
- AWS Operations

+++

## Additional Functionality

- Support all branches of DSpace - customize webapps per branch
- Make EC2/Docker startup logs accessible
- Post incremental status updates during startup process
- Explore ECS or EKS instead of EC2 for deployment
- Explore code pipeline to build and publish PR images

+++

## AWS Operations - Functinality

- Make logs accessible
- Security enhancments (see earlier slide)
- Regional deployment
- Find AMI by tag rather than hard-coding

+++

## AWS Operations - Portability to another account
- Generate AMI with CloudFormation
- Create Lambda security group with Cloud Formation
- Deploy Lambda and API Gateway with Cloud Formation
- Deploy S3 website with Cloud Formation
