The materials in this repository were the deliverables for the [Cloud Application Development on Amazon Web Services](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/cloud-application-development-on-aws) certificate program at the University of Washington.

The materials in the repository are also designed to propose a testing framework for the DSpace community that will simplify the process of testing DSpace code branches and DSpace pull requests.

The Dashboard Application URL is unpublished in order to limit AWS costs.  Contact the author if you would like a demonstration.

# DSpace Launcher Dashboard - Deploy a DSpace PR in Docker on AWS for Testing

DSpace is an open-source repository platform used by academic libraries and other institutions.
Many institutions have very limited developer support. End users within these institutions have expertise to offer to the project.
This project will build an automated system to build an deploy a test instance of DSpace using code from a specific pull request.
The system will carefully manage deployed instances in order to control costs.
